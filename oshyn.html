                    <p>Oshyn is a Sitecore and Optimizely development company. They came to us for a website redesign & rebrand to improve their user engagement rates. Our goal was to make their website more engaging, better organized, and more modern.</p>

                    <p>We took a deep dive into Oshyn's Google analytics and discovered they had a 83% bounce rate and the average session duration was 32 seconds. Additionally, Oshyn's blogs were wildly popular, but there was no easily accessible link to the blog.</p>

                Initially, we created 3 stylescapes for Oshyn to choose from. However, the first 3 stylescapes didn't fit Oshyn's vision for their new visual identity. They liked stylescape options 2 and 3 so we came up with an option that captures a balance between them, which is reflected in stylescape 4.

                The research showed the popularity of Oshyn's blog. However, there was no easily accessible link to the blog. To improve user engagement rates, it was a no-brainer to feature the blog more prominently in the navigation. Additionally, we used UX best practices to rebuild the website from the ground up with the goal of organizing their services in a more logical, user-friendly way.

                After our wireframes were approved, we began applying Oshyn's new visual identity. As mentioned in the research, Oshyn's blog posts were widely popular but there weren't any links to the blog. We made the blog more prominent to boost user engagement rates.
